## ford.py, (Yet Another) Static Blog Generator in Python

__Warning: `ford.py` is changing and fast. Specs are changing rapidly and until `ford.py` hits v1.0, it should be considered unstable.__

### Introduction

`ford.py` is based on the principle that we shouldn't

> reinvent the wheel.

So, it makes use of existing code libraries, in this case `flask` and extensions, to both serve and build static versions of websites while maintaining a minute footprint.

### Installation

	python install -r requirements.txt

### Quickstart

Run 

	make qs

Then, open `127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.

### Documentation

Coming soon. I promise :)

### Contributing

Any contribution is welcome. Just submit a pull request. ;)
