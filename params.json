{"tagline":"(Yet Another) Static Blog Generator in Python","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","google":"","name":"ford.py","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\n`ford.py` is based on the principle that we shouldn't\r\n\r\n> reinvent the wheel.\r\n\r\nSo, it makes use of existing code libraries, in this case `flask` and flask extensions, to both serve and build static versions of websites while maintaining a small footprint.\r\n\r\n*Note: As of this moment, ford.py only works with \"posts\", not \"pages.\" So really, it's limited to blogs.*\r\n\r\n### For Zeus' sake, WHY ANOTHER STATIC SITE GENERATOR?\r\n\r\nFor a few reasons actually. Compared to other solutions, `ford.py` is tiny. The project folder (including the default theme) is ~164 KB. `ford.py` itself is 8 KB. And, that's not 8 KB of pure code. As per `pylint`:\r\n\r\n##### Raw Metrics of ford.py\r\n\r\n|type      |number |%     |\r\n|:---------|:------|:-----|\r\n|code      |69     |48.59 |\r\n|docstring |54     |38.03 |\r\n|comment   |5      |3.52  |\r\n|empty     |14     |9.86  |\r\n\r\nSo, less than 4 KB of code. That's pretty small for a static site generator. \r\n\r\nIn addition, it uses popular packages and modules, so the code is _familiar_. For that reason, its easily extendable. But, more on that later.\r\n\r\n### Quickstart\r\n\r\nSo, you're interested in using `ford.py`, huh? Well, let's get started!\r\n\r\nHere are a few steps to get you on the way:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the project:\r\n\r\n\tGithub:\r\n\r\n\t\t$ git clone http://github.com/citruspi/ford.py.git\r\n\r\n\tBitbucket:\r\n\r\n\t\t$ git clone http://bitbucket.org/citruspi/ford.py.git\r\n\r\n2. Install requirements/dependencies:\r\n\r\n\t\t$ cd ford.py\r\n\t\t$ pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n\r\n3. Take her for a spin:\r\n\r\n\t\t$ python ford.py serve\r\n\r\nNow, if you open `127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser, you should be greated with something like:\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/uiMBP8r.png)\r\n\r\nIf that's what you have, you're golden.\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to use `ford.py`:\r\n\r\n\t$ python ford.py serve\r\n\r\n\\- or -\r\n\r\n\t$ python ford.py build\r\n\r\n`Serve` will serve the blog locally, for debugging. `Build` will generate a static version in a `build` folder.\r\n\r\n### Posts\r\n\r\n`ford.py` looks for content, or rather posts, in the `posts` directory. Posts should written in `Markdown` and end in `.md` extensions.\r\n\r\n__Any files which do not have an `.md` extension will not be recognized as posts. This is actually useful - save a file with another extension to save it as a draft.__\r\n\r\nThe layout for a post should look like this:\r\n\r\n\ttitle: hello world \r\n\tdate: 2013-01-27 \r\n\ttags: [hello, stuff] \r\n\tauthor: mark twain \r\n\tcategory: general\r\n\r\n\tAnd then the body of the post here.....\r\n\r\nEvery post should have basic meta like `title`, `date`, etc. Users (you?) can add on any tags you want to the meta. \r\n\r\nSo, you could add \r\n\r\n\tsticky: False\r\n\r\nto posts you want. \r\n\r\nWriting a food blog? Add \r\n\r\n\tingredients: [flour, milk, sugar]\r\n\r\nto the meta.\r\n\r\n__All tags are handled by the theme templates - some templates may ignore extra tags, some may ignore the basic tags, and some may require extra tags. `ford.py` simply provides the meta and body to the templates.__\r\n\r\n### Themes\r\n\r\n`ford.py` can use different themes - you have to provide them. A default theme, a port of orderedlist's minimal, is provided with the `ford.py` source.\r\n\r\nAdditional themes can be created by anybody easily.\r\n\r\nAll themes __must__ be placed in the `themes` directory. Each theme should have a `templates` and `static` directory - even if they are empty. In addition, they must contain certain files (even if they are blank):\r\n\r\n\t* 404.html\r\n\t* author.html\r\n\t* cat.html\r\n\t* index.html\r\n\t* page.html\r\n\t* tag.html\r\n\r\nThe `minimal` theme directory looks like this:\r\n\r\n\t$ ls -al themes/minimal/templates\r\n\r\n\t-rw-r--r--   1 mihir  staff   238 Jan 27 18:02 404.html\r\n    -rw-r--r--   1 mihir  staff   225 Jan 28 23:22 _list.html\r\n    -rw-r--r--   1 mihir  staff   203 Jan 28 23:22 author.html\r\n    -rw-r--r--   1 mihir  staff  2224 Jan 29 21:52 base.html\r\n    -rw-r--r--   1 mihir  staff   200 Jan 28 23:23 cat.html\r\n    -rw-r--r--   1 mihir  staff   455 Jan 28 23:23 index.html\r\n    -rw-r--r--   1 mihir  staff  2717 Jan 28 23:27 page.html\r\n    -rw-r--r--   1 mihir  staff   195 Jan 28 21:02 tag.html\r\n\r\nThemes __must__ be templated with `Jinja2`.\r\n\r\nTake a look at the minimal theme for an idea on how themes work.\r\n\r\n### config.yaml\r\n\r\nThe `config.yaml` requires one thing only - `theme`. Everything else included is used by the theme itself and not `ford.py` and should be defined in the theme's description.\r\n\r\nThe `minimal` theme asks for:\r\n\r\n\t* title\r\n\t* about //description\r\n\t* post_blog //what should come after the web blog on the index\r\n\t* footer \r\n\t* gauges_id // for gaug.es analytics\r\n\t* disqus_id // for disqus commenting system\r\n\r\nFor a valid `config.yaml` for the `minimal` theme, take a look at the one included in this repository.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nAs of now, there are three things which you should be aware of.\r\n\r\n1. Upon installation, __Markdown extra__ features like __tables__ will not render.\r\n\r\n\tThe problem lies in that `Flask-FlatPages` does not pass `extras` to the `Markdown` package by default.\r\n\r\n\tThe solution is to modify your installation of `Flask-FlatPages`. You have to change lines 34-40 of `__init__.py`.\r\n\r\n\tChange:\r\n\r\n\t\ttry:\r\n        \timport pygments\r\n    \texcept ImportError:\r\n\t        extensions = []\r\n\t    else:\r\n    \t    extensions = ['codehilite']\r\n    \treturn markdown.markdown(text, extensions)\r\n\r\n\tTo:\r\n\r\n\t\textensions = ['extra']\r\n    \r\n    \ttry:\r\n        \timport pygments\r\n    \texcept ImportError:\r\n       \t\tpass\r\n    \telse:\r\n        \textensions.append('codehilite')\r\n        \r\n    \treturn markdown.markdown(text, extensions)\r\n\r\n\tAnd save!\r\n\r\n2. The URL's in the static version of the blog will be absolute, not relative. \r\n\r\n\tSo, if you just double-click `index.html` in the `build` directory, the page will show up without CSS, JS, etc.\r\n\r\n\tThe static site __must__ be served by an HTTP server.\r\n\r\n3. When the blog is being `served locally` for debugging, 404's will automatically load the `404.html` page. The static site will not. You will have to set the error page in your HTTP server (Nginx, Apache, etc.) configuration.\r\n\r\n\tFor example, in my Nginx config, I had to add \r\n\r\n\t\terror_page 404 /404;\r\n\r\n\tto the server.\r\n\r\n### Extending\r\n\r\nAs mentioned previously, `ford.py` is written on top of `flask` and other flask extensions. \r\n\r\nTake a look at the source for the `ford.py` file, you'll find it familiar. You should be able to extend it as easily as any other `flask` project.\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\n_If you contribute, just add your name here and submit a pull request._\r\n\r\nAuthors/Contributors:\r\n\r\n* Mihir Singh\r\n\r\nShout out to [@remino](https://github.com/remino). \r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\n\r\nAny contribution is welcome.
